# whois-parsed
A wrapper for the fantastic whois module that parses whois data into consistent JSON across multiple tlds. Supports proxies requiring authentication with username and password.

Inspiration (and regex) borrowed from the python library https://bitbucket.org/richardpenman/pywhois

If you find this package useful please give us a star!

## Installation

  `npm install whois-parsed`

## Usage
```
var whoisOptions = {
  proxy: {
    ipaddress: '111.222.33.44',
    port: 1085,
    authentication: {
        username: "youruser",
        password: "yourpassword"
    },
    type: 5
  }
};
(async function(){
  const whois = require('whois-parsed');

  var results = await whois.lookup('google.com', whoisOptions);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));
})()

## Errors

whois-parsed does not handle retry logic by design. It isn't uncommon to have whois lookups throw errors if your application gets blocked or rate limited due to too many whois calls. You should implement retry logic, rate limiting, proxies, etc. in your application as needed.
